# Web-Design-Challenge

Using what I've learned about HTML and CSS I created a dashboard showing off the analysis of a prior Python/API assignment on weather data across major cities of the world.

In building this dashboard, I created 7 individual pages for each plot from my previous assignment, as well as a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The dashboard includes a landing page, a page where all the plots are compared, and another page to view the data used to build them.

The 7 pages consist of:
1. A ***Landing page*** with an explanation of the project and links to each visualization page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, along with a clickable image to take the veiwer to the visualizations.

2. ***Four visualization pages***, each with a descriptive title and heading tag, the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison, and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3. A ***Comparisons page*** that contains all of the visualizations on the same page to easily visually compare them and uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

4. A ***Data page*** that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. I created the table by using a bootstrap table component after first exporting the data from a .csv file as HTML by using Pandas.
